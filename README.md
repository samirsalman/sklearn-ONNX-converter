# ONNX sklearn converter

ONNX sklearn converter is a small python package that uses skl2onnx (ONNX official package) to convert sklearn models to ONNX format. This repo provide an easy-to-use framework to boost your sklearn models to production. 

## Getting Started

To use sklearn-onnx-converter you have to clone the repo and  install the package.

### Prerequisites

* Python >=3.8

### Installation



Before to use sklearn-onnx-converter you must install the package using pip
```bash
$ pip install .
```

### Docker

To build the docker image you can use the following command:
```bash
$ docker build . -t sklearn-onnx
```

## Usage

To convert a sklearn model to the ONNX format you can run the convert command as a bash script or using it as a Python script. (See the examples folder for more details).

### Bash script
```bash
$ python onnx_converter/onnx_converter.py -m PATH_TO_SKLEARN_MODEL -f PATH_TO_YOUR_FEATURE_CONFIG_FILE -o OUTPUT_FOLDER
```

### Python script

- Create a main.py:
```python
# main.py
from sklearn_onnx_converter import convert

if __name__ == "__main__":
    convert(
        # your sklearn model path
        model_path="model_path",
        # feature config YAML file
        feature_config="features.yaml",
        # output path
        output_path="output_dir",
    )

```

- run the script:
```bash
$ python main.py
```

### With docker

``` bash
$ docker run \
    -v INPUT_FOLDER_ABSOLUTE_PATH:/input \
    -v OUTPUT_FOLDER_ABSOLUTE_PATH:/output \
    sklearn-onnx \
    -m /input/MODEL_NAME \
    -o /output/OUTPUT_DIRECTORY \
    -f /input/FEATURE_CONFIG_FILE.yaml
```

## TODO

- [x] Add docker support
- [ ] Add more examples
